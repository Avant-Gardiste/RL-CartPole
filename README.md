# DQN-Cartpole

The cartpole problem is an inverted pendelum problem where a stick is balanced upright on a cart. The cart can be moved left or right to and the goal is to keep the stick from falling over. A positive reward of +1 is received for every time step that the stick is upright. When it falls past a certain degree then the "episode" is over and a new one can begin. CartPole can be found in OpenAI Gym's list of trainable environments. This project requires Python 3.5 with the Gym, numpy, and matplotlib libraries installed. The CartPole-V0 environment is used.
